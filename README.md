This project was created for Discord users who don’t want to manually delete hundreds of messages one by one.  

It’s built with **Python**, using the following libraries:  

- `tkinter`
- `threading`
- `pyautogui`
- `time`
- `keyboard`

You can configure it to target messages from a specific user by matching their profile picture.  
With a high confidence level, it won’t mistakenly detect the user’s status icon as their profile picture.

## Requirements

You need to have **Python** installed on your system.  
You can install it via the official Python website or by running:

```cmd
npm install python3
```
## How to run?

1. Make sure you are in the correct project directory.
2. Run the following command:
```
py main.py
```
